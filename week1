# Trusted Hardware

Trusted hardware forms the foundational trust anchors in various digital security systems, underpinning the integrity, confidentiality, and authentication of sensitive data and transactions. Understanding these technologies and their vulnerabilities not only highlights their indispensable role in secure communications and commerce but also emphasizes the importance of tailored security designs and threat modeling in defending against sophisticated adversaries.

## 1. The Evolution and Ubiquity of Trusted Hardware

### Historical Significance
- Credit cards and SIM cards represent early milestones where trusted hardware translated complex cryptographic methods into everyday convenience.

- Credit cards, once a privilege, have become ubiquitous with an estimated 22 billion cards in circulation globally as of 2018.

- SIM cards serve as simple, cost-effective, and reliable mechanisms for authentication, securing over 2 billion mobile subscribers worldwide.

- Trusted hardware components like black-boxes and trust anchors extend beyond finance, playing key roles in secure data analysis.

### Present-day Deployment
- Trusted hardware encompasses SIM cards, bank cards, embedded cryptographic devices, and cloud security modules.

- Their widespread presence is often underestimated despite being fundamental to secure transactions and communications.

## 2. Cornerstone Technologies: From Smart Cards to Hardware Security Modules

### SIM Cards as Security Game-changers
- Provide robust mechanisms for user authentication.

- Characterized by simplicity and cost-efficiency, making them the most prevalent form of trusted hardware.

### Credit/Debit Cards and EMV Smart Cards
- Revolutionized retail and banking through secure, cashless payment methods.

- EMV smart cards embed cryptographic protections to combat fraud and unauthorized use.

### Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Core to managing cryptographic keys within Public Key Infrastructures (PKI).

- Serve as black-box environments enforcing controlled access to sensitive keys.

- Designed to withstand physical and logical attacks, ensuring keys remain protected even under direct device access attempts.

- HSMs form fundamental anchors in securing cloud platforms and enterprise solutions.

## 3. The Double-edged Sword: Vulnerabilities and Real-world Incidents

### Security Challenges and Historical Failures
- Early magnetic stripe cards were vulnerable to skimming; ATM skimming remains an ongoing threat.

- Smart cards are prone to loss and exploitation due to weak initial implementations.

- Attackers leverage side-channel attacks: measuring execution time, temperature, and electrical signals to extract secret information.

### Notable Breaches and Mishaps
- Andata cards allowed API-based extraction of plaintext data, illustrating gaps in cryptographic access control.

- Buffer overflows in HSMs enabled firmware overwriting, demanding rigorous formal verification to ensure reliability.

- Speculative execution vulnerabilities broke isolation guarantees, revealing hardware complexities that adversaries can exploit.

- These incidents emphasize that security features inherently carry associated vulnerabilities, necessitating continuous vigilance and innovation.

## 4. Contemporary Development and Accessibility of Trusted Hardware

### Ease of Development
- Technologies like Java cards enable developers to write portable code with the principle "write once, run anywhere."

- Availability of simulators.

### Commercial and Research Trends
- Trusted hardware is increasingly affordable and accessible.

- Corporate interest in RFID and similar technologies for retail applications indicates broader adoption.

- Expertise is vital to know when and how to apply these tools effectively.

## 5. Emerging Technologies and Innovations in Trusted Hardware

### Intel SGX and TDX
- Heralded as revolutionary for cloud security with features like isolated execution and remote attestation.

- Upcoming Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) exist to extend virtualization and counter side-channel attacks.

### ARM TrustZone
- Provides isolated execution confined to verified applications.

- Strongly tied to ARM architecture, offering specialization at the cost of user-friendliness.

### OpenTitan and the Movement for Open Source Security
- Some projects have been plagued by closed-source code and discovered vulnerabilities.

- OpenTitan is a RISC-V based, open-source initiative designed to facilitate cryptographic and formal verification and enhance transparency.

## 6. Threats, Attacks, and Countermeasures

### Advanced Side-channels and Physical Attacks
- Attackers measure execution times, inject faults, conduct power analysis, and even gain physical access via debing insiders.

- The sophistication and motivation of adversaries necessitate increasingly robust defenses.

### Effective Defensive Strategies
- Adoption of constant-time implementations ensures that execution times remain invariant, obfuscating secret-dependent operations.

- Although not a panacea, this approach addresses fundamental side-channel vulnerabilities.

- Mitigation techniques also include fault injection resistance and awareness of speculative execution pitfalls.

### Design Trade-offs
- Achieving absolute security is impossible; systems must balance performance, cost, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.

- Security architectures often require tailored configurations matching application-specific risks.

## 7. Threat Modeling and the Security Mindset

### Key Elements of Threat Modeling
- Define system and trust models: entities, APIs.
- Identify trusted parties, adversaries, and their capabilities.
- Assess known vulnerabilities and their associated costs.
- Decide acceptable risk thresholds based on real-world context.
