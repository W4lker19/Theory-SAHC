## Chapter: Security and Applications of Smart Cards

Smart cards represent a critical technological advancement in secure, portable, and tamper-resistant data storage and processing. Typically **credit card-sized** and composed of **flexible plastic**, these cards embed a **micro-module** -- a silicon-based integrated circuit chip protected by a gold plate. The micro-module contains essential components such as **microprocessor** and **memory**, enabling the card to execute secure operations autonomously. This chapter explores the foundational concepts of smart cards, their architecture, variations, applications, security standards, attack vectors, and lifecycle, illustrating their significance in modern secure communications, identity verification, and financial transactions.

Key Vocabulary includes **micro-controller, memory types (RAM, ROM, EEPROM), APDUs (Application Protocol Data Units), cryptographic operations, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**, all of which underpin smart card functionality and security.
